Whisper
=======

![Whisper Logo](Assets/WhisperBackground-Branding.png)

Whisper is a provider-driven "clipboard content generator" for Windows. It runs in the background and provides content directly to your clipboard. New Passwords, Guids, and Random Numbers are bundled with the core application, but this could be extended to anything - Number Plates, Harry Potter Quotes, or Pokemon Names for example.

![Whisper Shell](ReadMe.Assets/Shell01.png)

Whisper content is configurable within the bounds of the content providers' constraints, and can be configured into *Presets*. *Presets* can then be used within the application shell to generate content accordingly.

Whisper can be minimised to run in the shell for easy access if desired. Future updates will likely add more functionality for background operation.
